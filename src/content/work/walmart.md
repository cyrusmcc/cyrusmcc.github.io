With Walmart I've made major contributions to enterprise-scale digital advertising infrastructure, developing a comprehensive adtech platform using Next.js, React, and Redis that manages 50,000+ in-store advertisement screens across 4,700+ store locations nationwide. Built out device management functionality including remote health monitoring, automated firmware updates, and real-time content streaming capabilities, leading to reduced manual intervention and improved operational efficiency for technicians managing digital advertising at scale.

Previously focused on reliability engineering working with MERN applications dealing with incident management and observability solutions of Walmart's post purchase (order fulfillment, delivery, return flows). Implemented intelligent monitoring systems using LLM and ServiceNow API integrations leading to a reduction in reporting incident noise by ~80% and streamlined manually monitored categories from ~35 down to a single incident stream, leading to faster issue detection and 24/7 automated incident monitoring/resolution coverage.
