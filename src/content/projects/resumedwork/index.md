Resumed.work originated as a tool I created to help me navigate the rough job market during my search for a tech position. I realized I needed an organized and methodical approach when applying to jobs, as I was spending a significant amount of time submitting applications and trying to modify my resumes to increase my chances of being seen by a real person.

Resumed.work streamlines the process of resume creation, application tracking, and resume version management, providing a one-click method to optimize your resume for the position you're applying to! It gives you the tools you need to manage and optimize your job searches through application tracking boards, on-site resume creation, resume version management, and more!


With the Resumed.work Chrome extension, job hunters can track their applications and optimize their resumes directly from the job application page on supported job boards. Resumed.work aims to offer a vast collection of tools designed to help job seekers optimize their search, save time by increasing the chance their resume gets seen by real humans, and provide the resources needed to navigate a challenging and competitive job market.

The frontend is developed with Astro.js & React. I'm using ShadCN as well as tailwind for the components/styling, lovely tools those are. Using https://react-pdf.org/ for the resume creation. The extension is made with Svelte.js. The backend is an express app and everything is hosted on a Digital Ocean droplet.
